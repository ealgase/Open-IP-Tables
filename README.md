#Open IP Tables
Tired of that Linux firewall getting in your way?  Well, now you can disable blocking ports all at once!  Just install Python3, and run `python3 index.py`.
#I don't want to install Python3
Just run `sudo bash index.sh`
#How long will this take to run?
20 to 30 minutes
#I don't want it to be verbose!!!
Non-verbose mode coming soon!
